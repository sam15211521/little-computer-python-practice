#finds the average of two numbers

# Write your average function here:

def average(num1, num2):
    sum = num1 +num2
    avg = sum/(2)
    return avg

# Uncomment these function calls to test your average function:
print(average(1, 100))
# The average of 1 and 100 is 50.5
print(average(1, -1))
# The average of 1 and -1 is 0
